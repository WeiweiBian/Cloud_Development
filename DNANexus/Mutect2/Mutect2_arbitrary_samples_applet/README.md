# Mutect2

This repository contains scripts intent on running the remainder of the samples (if the total samples were not divisible by 50).

Depending on trade-offs, mutect_arbitrary_samples_orientation can be run by itself or mutect_50_samples_orientation and mutect_arbitrary_samples_orientation can be run together - this is slightly more efficient in terms of runtime and cost.
